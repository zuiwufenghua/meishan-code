Package info
<br><br>
This package provides the classes for the dependency parser. The parser uses the following techniques: <br>
- For dependency decoding, we use the decoder of (Carrears, 2007)<br> 
- For training, we use Mira with Hash Kernel (Bohnet, 2010) <br>
- For non-projective dependency parsing, we use the non-projective approximation algorithm (McDonald, 2006) adapted to the higher order decoder of Carrears and an adaption threshold (Bohnet, 2010)<br>
